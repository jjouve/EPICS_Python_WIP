"""
Fits a spectrum to a set of Gaussian peaks.  This class is independent of the
Mca class library, except that the "fit" and "peak" objects used must have
the fields defined as they are for the McaFit and McaPeak classes.

Modification history:
   Mark Rivers, October 21, 1998.
      This is the latest re-write of a routine which has a long history, begun
      at X-26 at the NSLS.  The original version was written in a program called
      SPCALC, and was then ported to IDL.
      These early versions used IMSL for the least-squares routine.  The port to
      CURVEFIT, so that no external software package is required, was done in
      1998.

   Mark Rivers, Nov. 12, 1998.
      Significant re-write to use MPFITFUN in place of CURVEFIT

   Mark Rivers, Feb. 1, 2001.
      Changed amplitude ratio calculation so that the AREA of the two peaks
      has the specified ratio, rather than the AMPLITUDE.  This is done by
      adjusting the constrained ratio by the relative peak widths.

   Mark Rivers, Sept 18, 2002.
      Converted from IDL to Python.

   Sept 25., 2002 MLR
      - Previously several fields in the peaks could be clobbered if a
        peak was outside the energy range of the spectrum.  Added new .ignore
        field to McaPeak to work around this problem and use that field here.

      predicted:
         An Mca object containing the predicted Mca spectrum.

   Restrictions:
      This function is presently limited to fitting Gaussian peaks.  It may
      be extended in the future to fit other peak shapes.

   Procedure:
      In general a Gaussian peak has 3 adjustable parameters: position 
      (or energy), sigma (or FWHM), and amplitude (or area).  For many
      applications, however, not all of these parameters should be
      adjustable during the fit.  For example, in XRF analysis the energy of
      the peaks is known, and should not be optimized.  However, the overall
      energy calibration coefficients for the entire spectrum, which relate
      channel number to energy, might well be optimized during the fit.
      Similarly, the FWHM of XRF peaks are not independent, but rather
      typically follow a predictable detector response function:
          FWHM = A + B*sqrt(energy)
      Finally, even the amplitude of an XRF peak might not be a free
      parameter, since, for example one might want to constrain the K-beta 
      peak to be a fixed fraction of the K-alpha.  Such constraints allow 
      one to fit overlapping K-alpha/K-beta peaks with much better accuracy.

      This procedure is designed to be very flexible in terms of which
      parameters are fixed and which ones are optimized.  The constraints are
      communicated via the Fit and Peaks structures.

      The energy of each channel is assumed to obey the relation: 
          energy = energy_offset + (channel * energy_slope)

      These parameters control the fit for peaks whose energy is fixed, 
      rather than being a fit parameter.
      If Fit.energy_flag is 1 then these energy calibration coefficients
      will be optimized during the fitting process. If it is 0 then these
      energy calibration coefficients are assumed to be correct and are not 
      optimized.  Not optimizing the energy calibration coefficients can 
      both speed up the fitting process and lead to more stable results when 
      fitting small peaks.  This function does a sanity check and will not
      optimize these energy calibration coefficients unless at least 2 peaks
      have their .energy_flag field set to 0, so that they use these global
      calibration coefficients.

      The FWHM of the peaks is assumed to obey the relation:
          fwhm = fwhm_offset + (fwhm_slope * sqrt(energy))
      These parameters control the fit for peaks whose FWHM is neither fixed 
      nor a fit parameter.
      If Fit.fwhm_flag is 1 then these coefficients will be optimized during
      the fitting process. If it is 0 then the specified coefficients are 
      assumed to be correct and are not optimized. Not optimizing the FWHM
      coeffcients can both speed up the fitting process and lead to more 
      stable results when fitting very small peaks. This function does a 
      sanity check and will not optimize these FWHM calibration coefficients 
      unless at least 2 peaks have their .fwhm_flag field set to 0, so that 
      they use these global calibration coefficients.

      This function also optimizes the following parameters:
          - The amplitudes of all peaks whose .ampl_factor field is 0
          - The energies of all peaks whose .energy_flag field is 1
          - The FWHM of all peaks whose .fwhm_flag field is 1

      The parameter which is the minimized during the fitting process is 
      chi^2, defined as:
                                                   2
         2            y_obs[i]    -     y_pred[i]
      chi  = sum (  ---------------------------- )
              i              sigma[i]

      where y_obs[i] is the observed counts in channel i, y_pred is the
      predicted counts in channel i, and sigma[i] is the standard deviation
      of y_obs[i].

      This function assumes that:

      sigma[i] = y_obs[i] ** chi_exponent

      e.g. that the standard deviation in each channel is equal to the counts
      in the channel to some power. For photon counting spectra where Poisson
      statistics apply chi_exponent=0.5, and this is the default. Setting
      chi_exponent=0. will set all of the sigma[i] values to 1., and the fit
      would then be minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals. This
      should tend to result in a better fit for the large peaks in a spectrum
      and a poorer fit for the smaller peaks. Setting chi_exponent=1.0 will
      result in a minimization of the sum of the squares of the relative error
      in each channel. This should tend to weight the fit more strongly toward
      the small peaks.

      If .ampl_factor for a peak is 0., then the amplitude of the peak is a 
      fit parameter. If the amplitude_factor is non-zero then the amplitude 
      of this peak is not a fit parameter, but rather is constrained to
      be equal to the amplitude of the last previous peak in the array which 
      had an amplitude factor of zero, times the amplitude_factor. This can 
      be used, for instance, fit K-alpha and K-beta x-ray lines when the 
      alpha/beta ratio is known, and one wants to add this known constraint 
      to the fitting process.
      For example:
          peaks = replicate({mca_peak}, 3)
          # Fe Ka is the "reference" peak
          peaks[0].initial_energy=6.40 & peaks[0].ampl_factor=0.0 
          # Si-Ka escape peak is 3% of Fe Ka at 4.66 keV
          peaks[1].initial_energy=4.66 & peaks[1].ampl_factor=0.03
          # Fe-Kb is 23% of Fe Ka
          peaks[2].initial_energy=7.06 & peaks[2].ampl_factor=0.23
      In this example the amplitude of the Fe-Ka peak will be fitted, but the
      amplitudes of the escape peak and the Fe-Kb peak are constrained to
      be fixed fractions of the Fe-Ka peak.  The reference peak is always the
      closest preceding peak in the array for which ampl_factor is 0.
