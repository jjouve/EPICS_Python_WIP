1.  Pointer Handling Library
============================

%include pointer.i

The pointer.i library provides run-time support for managing and 
manipulating a variety of C/C++ pointer values.  In particular,
you can create various kinds of objects and dereference common
pointer types.  This is done through a common set of functions:

    ptrcast      - Casts a pointer to a new type
    ptrvalue     - Dereferences a pointer 
    ptrset       - Set the value of an object referenced by 
                   a pointer.
    ptrcreate    - Create a new object and return a pointer.
    ptrfree      - Free the memory allocated by ptrcreate.
    ptradd       - Increment/decrement a pointer value.
    ptrmap       - Make two datatypes equivalent to each other.
                   (Is a runtime equivalent of typedef).

When creating, dereferencing, or setting the value of pointer
variable, only the common C datatypes of int, short, long, float,
double, char, and char * are currently supported.   Other
datatypes may generate an error.

One of the more interesting aspects of this library is that
it operates with a wide range of datatypes.  For example,
the "ptrvalue" function can dereference "double *", "int *",
"long *", "char *", and other datatypes. Since SWIG encodes
pointers with type information, this can be done transparently
and in most cases, you can dereference a pointer without
ever knowing what type it actually is.

This library is primarily designed for utility, not high 
performance (the dynamic determination of pointer types takes
more work than most normal wrapper functions).  As a result,
you may achieve better performance by writing customized
"helper" functions if you're making lots of calls to these
functions in inner loops or other intensive operations.

ptrcast(ptr,type)
        Casts a pointer ptr to a new datatype given by the string type.
        type may be either the SWIG generated representation of a datatype
        or the C representation.  For example :
        
           ptrcast(ptr,"double_p");   # Python representation
           ptrcast(ptr,"double *");    # C representation
        
        A new pointer value is returned.   ptr may also be an integer
        value in which case the value will be used to set the pointer
        value.  For example :
        
           a = ptrcast(0,"Vector_p");
        
        Will create a NULL pointer of type "Vector_p"
        
        The casting operation is sensitive to formatting.  As a result,
        "double *" is different than "double*".  As a result of thumb,
        there should always be exactly one space between the C datatype
        and any pointer specifiers (*).
        
ptrvalue(ptr,index,type)
        Returns the value that a pointer is pointing to (ie. dereferencing).
        The type is automatically inferred by the pointer type--thus, an
        integer pointer will return an integer, a double will return a double,
        and so on.   The index and type fields are optional parameters.  When
        an index is specified, this function returns the value of ptr[index].
        This allows array access.   When a type is specified, it overrides
        the given pointer type.   Examples :
        
           ptrvalue(a)             #  Returns the value *a
           ptrvalue(a,10)          #  Returns the value a[10]
           ptrvalue(a,10,"double") #  Returns a[10] assuming a is a double *
        
ptrset(ptr,value,index,type)
        Sets the value pointed to by a pointer.  The type is automatically
        inferred from the pointer type so this function will work for
        integers, floats, doubles, etc...  The index and type fields are
        optional.  When an index is given, it provides array access.  When
        type is specified, it overrides the given pointer type.  Examples :
        
          ptrset(a,3)            # Sets the value *a = 3
          ptrset(a,3,10)         # Sets a[10] = 3
          ptrset(a,3,10,"int")   # Sets a[10] = 3 assuming a is a int *
        
ptrcreate(type,value,nitems)
        Creates a new object and returns a pointer to it.  This function 
        can be used to create various kinds of objects for use in C functions.
        type specifies the basic C datatype to create and value is an
        optional parameter that can be used to set the initial value of the
        object.  nitems is an optional parameter that can be used to create
        an array.  This function results in a memory allocation using
        malloc().  Examples :
        
          a = ptrcreate("double")     # Create a new double, return pointer
          a = ptrcreate("int",7)      # Create an integer, set value to 7
          a = ptrcreate("int",0,1000) # Create an integer array with initial
                                      # values all set to zero
        
        This function only recognizes a few common C datatypes as listed below :
        
               int, short, long, float, double, char, char *, void
        
        All other datatypes will result in an error.  However, other
        datatypes can be created by using the ptrcast function.  For
        example:
        
         a = ptrcast(ptrcreate("int",0,100),"unsigned int *")
        
ptrfree(ptr)
        Destroys the memory pointed to by ptr.  This function calls free()
        and should only be used with objects created by ptrcreate().  Since
        this function calls free, it may work with other objects, but this
        is generally discouraged unless you absolutely know what you're
        doing.
        
ptradd(ptr,offset)
        Adds a value to the current pointer value.  For the C datatypes of
        int, short, long, float, double, and char, the offset value is the
        number of objects and works in exactly the same manner as in C.  For
        example, the following code steps through the elements of an array
        
         a = ptrcreate("double",0,100);    # Create an array double a[100]
         b = a;
         for i in range(0,100):
             ptrset(b,0.0025*i);           # set *b = 0.0025*i
             b = ptradd(b,1);              # b++ (go to next double)
        
        In this case, adding one to b goes to the next double.
        
        For all other datatypes (including all complex datatypes), the
        offset corresponds to bytes.  This function does not perform any
        bounds checking and negative offsets are perfectly legal.  
        
ptrmap(type1,type2)
        This is a rarely used function that performs essentially the same
        operation as a C typedef.  To manage datatypes at run-time, SWIG
        modules manage an internal symbol table of type mappings.  This
        table keeps track of which types are equivalent to each other.  The
        ptrmap() function provides a mechanism for scripts to add symbols
        to this table.  For example :
        
           ptrmap("double_p","Real_p");
        
        would make the types "doublePtr" and "RealPtr" equivalent to each
        other.  Pointers of either type could now be used interchangably.
        
        Normally this function is not needed, but it can be used to
        circumvent SWIG's normal type-checking behavior or to work around
        weird type-handling problems.
        
captrcast(ptr,type)
        Casts a pointer ptr to a new datatype given by the string type.
        type may be either the SWIG generated representation of a datatype
        or the C representation.  For example :
        
           ptrcast(ptr,"double_p");   # Python representation
           ptrcast(ptr,"double *");    # C representation
        
        A new pointer value is returned.   ptr may also be an integer
        value in which case the value will be used to set the pointer
        value.  For example :
        
           a = ptrcast(0,"Vector_p");
        
        Will create a NULL pointer of type "Vector_p"
        
        The casting operation is sensitive to formatting.  As a result,
        "double *" is different than "double*".  As a result of thumb,
        there should always be exactly one space between the C datatype
        and any pointer specifiers (*).
        
captrvalue(ptr,index,type)
        Returns the value that a pointer is pointing to (ie. dereferencing).
        The type is automatically inferred by the pointer type--thus, an
        integer pointer will return an integer, a double will return a double,
        and so on.   The index and type fields are optional parameters.  When
        an index is specified, this function returns the value of ptr[index].
        This allows array access.   When a type is specified, it overrides
        the given pointer type.   Examples :
        
           ptrvalue(a)             #  Returns the value *a
           ptrvalue(a,10)          #  Returns the value a[10]
           ptrvalue(a,10,"double") #  Returns a[10] assuming a is a double *
        
captrset(ptr,value,index,type)
        Sets the value pointed to by a pointer.  The type is automatically
        inferred from the pointer type so this function will work for
        integers, floats, doubles, etc...  The index and type fields are
        optional.  When an index is given, it provides array access.  When
        type is specified, it overrides the given pointer type.  Examples :
        
          ptrset(a,3)            # Sets the value *a = 3
          ptrset(a,3,10)         # Sets a[10] = 3
          ptrset(a,3,10,"int")   # Sets a[10] = 3 assuming a is a int *
        
captrcreate(type,value,nitems)
        Creates a new object and returns a pointer to it.  This function 
        can be used to create various kinds of objects for use in C functions.
        type specifies the basic C datatype to create and value is an
        optional parameter that can be used to set the initial value of the
        object.  nitems is an optional parameter that can be used to create
        an array.  This function results in a memory allocation using
        malloc().  Examples :
        
          a = ptrcreate("double")     # Create a new double, return pointer
          a = ptrcreate("int",7)      # Create an integer, set value to 7
          a = ptrcreate("int",0,1000) # Create an integer array with initial
                                      # values all set to zero
        
        This function only recognizes a few common C datatypes as listed below :
        
               int, short, long, float, double, char, char *, void
        
        All other datatypes will result in an error.  However, other
        datatypes can be created by using the ptrcast function.  For
        example:
        
         a = ptrcast(ptrcreate("int",0,100),"unsigned int *")
        
captrfree(ptr)
        Destroys the memory pointed to by ptr.  This function calls free()
        and should only be used with objects created by ptrcreate().  Since
        this function calls free, it may work with other objects, but this
        is generally discouraged unless you absolutely know what you're
        doing.
        
captradd(ptr,offset)
        Adds a value to the current pointer value.  For the C datatypes of
        int, short, long, float, double, and char, the offset value is the
        number of objects and works in exactly the same manner as in C.  For
        example, the following code steps through the elements of an array
        
         a = ptrcreate("double",0,100);    # Create an array double a[100]
         b = a;
         for i in range(0,100):
             ptrset(b,0.0025*i);           # set *b = 0.0025*i
             b = ptradd(b,1);              # b++ (go to next double)
        
        In this case, adding one to b goes to the next double.
        
        For all other datatypes (including all complex datatypes), the
        offset corresponds to bytes.  This function does not perform any
        bounds checking and negative offsets are perfectly legal.
